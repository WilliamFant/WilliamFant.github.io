          <h3>Coding</h3>
          <p>
            I am a highly motivated learner with a passion for coding. I have
            been honing my skills since the 4th grade. Since then I have been
            learning concepts such as pseudo code, binary code, Java, Python,
            HTML, CSS, and JavaScript throughout high school. I am currently in
            the Commonwealth Coders course, which taught me everything I need to
            know to be a junior web developer and create functional websites
            from scratch. I have attended various coding classes over the years,
            contributing to my confidence in writing efficient and effective
            code. I am committed to pursuing future opportunities in web
            development and continually growing in this dynamic field.

          <h3>Sales</h3>
          <p>
            Working at Hurt Auto Sales has been an invaluable experience for me,
            providing me with skills that extend beyond the realm of car sales.
            From a young age, I began assisting my grandfather with various
            tasks, such as washing cars, which eventually led to me becoming a
            better salesman and gaining expertise in paperwork and car
            maintenance. Through my role as a salesman, I have learned effective
            communication skills and gained confidence when interacting with
            customers, influenced by my grandfather's approach of shaking hands
            and making friends. I have also learned how to advertise through
            different mediums, including social media, radio, newspaper, online,
            and in-person. Additionally, I have learned that presentation is key
            when it comes to selling products, and I have honed my skills in
            presenting items in an informative and appealing manner that
            resonates with customers. Overall, my experience at Hurt Auto Sales
            has allowed me to grow both personally and professionally, and I am
            grateful for the skills and knowledge I have gained.

          <h3>My Personal Life</h3>
          <p>
            My experiences in car modification and restoration and participating
            in team sports have taught me skills that are also essential in my
            coding career. Problem solving is a crucial aspect of coding, just
            as it is in restoring a car or working with a team in sports.
            Restoring Minnie's (my great aunt's) 1993 Honda Del Sol S or what
            she likes to call it "the little red car" requires identifying
            problems, devising a plan to address them, and executing that plan
            to bring the car back to its original glory (with a engine swap and
            turbo kit). Similarly, coding requires the ability to identify and
            solve problems by breaking them down into smaller, manageable pieces
            and working towards a solution.
            <br />
            <br />
            Additionally, teamwork and communication skills are critical in both
            sports and coding. In soccer, I learned how to work with my
            teammates towards a common goal and communicate effectively on the
            field. In coding, working collaboratively with a team to develop and
            execute a project requires the same level of teamwork and
            communication skills. Ultimately, my personal interests and
            experiences have helped me develop skills that are not only valuable
            in my personal life but also applicable in my coding career.
            <br />
            <br />
            Aside from my professional and personal endeavors, I also enjoy
            spending time with friends and pursuing various hobbies. One of my
            favorite activities is going to the lake, where I can relax on a
            boat, drive jet ski's, and wake board. I also enjoy learning to play
            the guitar and have spent countless hours practicing this skill. My
            love for cars extends beyond restoration and modification, and I
            enjoy driving and exploring new places whenever I can. Additionally,
            I have a passion for solving Rubik's cubes, which has allowed me to
            sharpen my problem-solving abilities and analytical skills. Lastly,
            I am a fan of Guitar Hero and enjoy challenging my friends to
            compete against me. Through these hobbies, I have learned to manage
            my time effectively, appreciate the value of hard work and
            dedication, and develop a well-rounded personality.
